# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System with Cosine Similarity

This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** implemented using **Python**. By calculating the **cosine similarity** of movie descriptions using the **TF-IDF Vectorization technique**, the system suggests movies similar to a given user-input movie.

## ðŸ“‹ Features  
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Finds similar movies based on textual data (e.g., movie overviews).  
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converts text data into numerical vectors.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movies.  
- **Interactive Input**: The user inputs a movie title and receives similar movie recommendations.
